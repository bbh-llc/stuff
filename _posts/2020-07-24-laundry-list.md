# Breaking Down FAST

The creatively-named 5G FAST Plan [Facilitate America's Superiority in 5G Technology](https://www.fcc.gov/5G) outlines the strategy that the FCC is taking for 5G Deployment in United States. This article aims to break down components of that plan, and how it might impact TV & Cable internet consumers, particularly those served by Utilities rather than larger MSOs.

## Where is the Spectrum coming from (or atleast a part of)

Like the 2009 era closing of [analog transmissions in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_television_transition_in_the_United_States), which freed up spectrum for uses other than TV services, the 5G spectrum auction is clearing the 3550-3700 MHz band ((3.5 GHz band) which has typically been used for Fixed Satellite Service (space-to-Earth) earth stations. The caveat is that incumbent providers have been provided with exceptions for priority access. the List of these protected (for now) assets is under the [FSS API service](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/broadband-division/35-ghz-band/35-ghz-band-protected-fixed-satellite). For a more intuitive sense, we have created a map of these spots embedded below. (Private information has deliberately been scrubbed)
