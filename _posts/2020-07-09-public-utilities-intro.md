Public Utlities that provide internet services (& TV & Phone, though not to a similar uptake) to their subscribers exist in a very interesting spot - <!--more-->
while they tend to be funded/backed by the local municipalities and thus enjoy some tax/subsidy benefits, they also compete with larger and more established
players that may be operating in their market viz. Comcast, Charter, Altice and so forth. Therefore, their services tend to be evaluated in the same 
breath as someone who perhaps has a billion dollars set aside for [engineering budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast_Technology_Center)

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name, greeting):
  return print(f'{greeting}, {name}')

print_hi('Ankush', 'hi')
#prints 'Hi, Ankush' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
