This is part 1 of a potential 2-part series on the 5G/CBRS auctions that are going on right now in the US

# Breaking Down FAST (Part 1)

The creatively-named 5G FAST Plan - [Facilitate America's Superiority in 5G Technology](https://www.fcc.gov/5G) -  outlines the strategy that the FCC is taking for 5G Deployment in United States. This article aims to break down components of that plan, and how it might impact TV & internet consumers, particularly those served by Utilities rather than larger MSOs.

## Where is the Spectrum coming from

Like the 2009-era closing of [analog transmissions in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_television_transition_in_the_United_States), which freed up spectrum for uses other than TV services, *part of* the 5G spectrum auction is clearing the 3550-3700 MHz band (The 3.5 GHz band) which has typically been used for Fixed Satellite Service (Space-to-Earth) earth stations. The caveat is that incumbent providers have been provided with exceptions for priority access. A list of these protected (for now) assets is under the [FSS API service](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/broadband-division/35-ghz-band/35-ghz-band-protected-fixed-satellite). For a more intuitive sense, we have created a map of these spots embedded below.

This map is interesting, not only because of potential 5G customers in the area who will probably not look forward to having their connections randomly drop in & out over [SAS](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/35-ghz-band/35-ghz-band-overview#spectrum-access-system) hiccups, but more so because it outlines where & how many essential current services there are on the entire radio spectrum. Given what we see here, its not improbable to note the potential scope of the legacy tech burden that we're carrying on inefficient use of radio resources.

## What is the current status of auctions

[Auction 105](https://www.fcc.gov/document/auction-105-35-ghz-qualified-bidders) currently underway, is for Priority Access Licenses (PALs) in the 3550-3650 MHz band. It offers the greatest number of spectrum licenses **ever made** available for bidding in a single auction and is intended to further deployment of fifth-generation (5G) wireless, the Internet of Things (IoT), and other advanced spectrum-based services in the United States. (*sic*)

What it looks like (as of 7/28/2020):

| Measure      | Quantity |
| :--- | :----: |
| Gross Proceeds as of 7/20/2020      | $554,067,339     |
| Qualified Bidders   | 271        |
| Counties with Demand > Supply   | 1057        |
| Counties with Demand = Supply  | 681        |
| Counties with Demand < Supply   | 1495        |

## So who are we moving ...FAST for?

In what was billed as the largest auction ever, the results are kind of underwhelming. We have to note that this is the result after 7 rounds of bidding and we are expecting to see another 2 rounds on Wednesday (7/29/2020) & Thursday (7/30/2020). Looking at the results so far, we have 3575 census tracts or over **15%** of auctionable sites that have 0 bidders. It is curious to note that these constitute around **7.7%** of overall census population. I will be monitoring & publishing an update with the final results of the auction at the end of this month and rel-ook at the data to see what sold at par, below par and did not at all.

## Tying in to local impact

While spectrum sales tend to be flashy (and draw all the news), the real impact of 5G would be felt in its deployment. This isnt like the 3G/4G era where 200 ft towers would provide the necessary telecommunications infrastructure - In fact, most of 5G could very well be smaller pole-mount cells that sit on top of a Utility Pole and provide hyper-local coverage and ability to integrate with other local services such as IoT.

Traditionally, ownership of Poles tends to fall within municipal jurisdictions, but with the aggressive 5G infrastructure deployment posture adopted by [FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-facilitates-wireless-infrastructure-deployment-5g), utilities may soon have short 60-90 day "shot-clocks" to provide access to their real-estate with no competing/symbiotic strategy in place.

## Long-term implications

It is hard not to look at aggressively deployed policies and not be concerned about the hidden costs of these decisions. These costs can manifest themselves in the shape of monopolies/oligopolies to the consumer and loss of potential revenue from local government. One thing is very clear - the 5G landscape is being ~~decided~~ carved out right now.
