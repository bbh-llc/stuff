The FCC's deadline for C-Band Relocation Lump Sum payment is coming up next Monday (Sept 14) - basically operators who use this 500Mhz block of radio spectrum to distribute video content will be vacating it in order to enable 5G operations (see my article on Article 105 auctions here). Since the intersection between video content providers and 5G operators is vanishingly small, it makes sense to create new licenses rather than try to retrofit licensing terms.

### FCC perspective

### Cable Providers' perspective
Organizations such as [ACA Connects](https://acaconnects.org/#countdown) have tried to appeal the order on the basis that FCC has not provided enough time to Cable Operators to viably look for sourcing/pricing in order to retain current levels of service with their customers. This includes the pricing for integrated receivers/decoders that are used to (as the name suggests) - receive & decode satellite signals and provide them to their customers as video services.

### Who benefits
If we try to look at the data provided by the FCC on the 16000+ stations that are eligible for this payment, there emerges a very non-intuitive trend

here's the split of stations by business type - MSO/Cable Operatos, Correctional Facilities, Evangelical TV entities, governmental entities and Others(too small a set to classify separately)


### How much money has been allocated for this activity

There are some assumptions that have been made while calculating the degree of payouts. This assumes that operators will indeed opt for receiving a lump-sum payment that they are eligible for
