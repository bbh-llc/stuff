## Our Story

Broadband Holdings LLC started in 2005 to cater to the needs of  mid-tier operators who were trying to compete with bigger and more established tier-1 cable companies. We brought in expertise on how to successfully run a smaller but more efficient cable operation without compromising on quality and customer satisfaction.
